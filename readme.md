# Quick & Dirty .mbox to .csv
### It just does the thing.


## Instructions:
1.  Open terminal window and set current directory to mboxer
    + Ex.  If mboxer file is on desktop: `cd Desktop/mboxer/`

    *This step optional of course, just adjust subsequent files paths to suit.*
2.  Place .mbox file for conversion in mboxer folder as 'input.mbox'
3.  Back in terminal window, call the python script: `python mboxer.py`
4.  Script will run for a minute, and then print a success message - your CSV will now be in the mboxer folder as 'output.csv'
5.  Profit!  Or poke Ash if it doesn't work ;)
